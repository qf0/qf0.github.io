# Preamble

So, this blog post is going to talk about computers affect your health. I'm primiarly going to focus on the physical aspects. 

## Laptops

Laptops have a small screen, touchpad, and keyboard. Therefor making you violate ergonomic guidelines. They're convenient, and portable. However, what's the convenience worth if they cause you pain? I recommend reading the following Harvard Medical School articles to read more about this. https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/prevent-pain-from-computer-use https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/pandemic-posture-hurting-your-back-you-can-fix-it

## Phones

Have you ever bumped in to someone on the sidewalk that was walking while texting? Or that you almost ran over while cyling, or driving? Well even if you didn't you can still get my point by reading these articles. https://www.fcc.gov/distracted-walking-campus-concern https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/cctv-footage-shows-how-distraction-thieves-use-trick-to-steal-your-phone-in-seconds-a3455111.html They cause deaths by texting while driving. https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving Phones also cause bad posture and therefore are egronomic. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6527223/ Phones are also harmful to children. Even though most parents use phones as a pacifer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwyDCHf5iCY The legal age, and most terms of service requires people to be at least 13 years of ago to register on many websites. Which I assume Apple has a similar requirement.

## PC

PCs are bad ergonomically. https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/prevent-pain-from-computer-use Tower PCs are often heavy to carry. CRTs monitors are very heavy.
