I've nearly been homeless a few times in my lifetime, but I've been fortunate that family members have allowed me to stay at their homes. People seem to think that homeless people are lazy or are self-destructive drug addicts etc. But most people barely even survive and all it takes it to get fired or an unexcepted life event to happen for someone to become homeless. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have family members that will let them stay with them etc. 
The times I nearly became homeless was due to natural disasters and because of ill financial choices that my parent made. Even now that I'm making decent money I'm thinking about what I would do if I got fired, noting locations that seem decent to crash at, janitor jobs etc. I noticed a place where I could charge my laptop and phone for free. 
Entry level jobs rarely offer health insurance (if they did it's probably just bronze level) and good pay (min wage is probably not even enough to get a decent studio). I admit that there are probably homeless people who destoryed their life due to drugs or because they just gave up on life etc. But it's not fair to presume such things about people experiencing homelessness.
