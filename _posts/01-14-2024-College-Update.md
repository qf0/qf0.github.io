Welp, I finished my first semester at Berea, and I've started the second semester. It's very boring here and I want to go back to working full-time. The Computer Science classes are super easy. Last semester I got a 3.0+ GPA and I skipped classes often and stopped reading the textbook after midterms.
I'm still fighting some accommodation saga and drama. On the plus side I'm a full-ride scholarship and I think of college as a free vacation. 

Oh yeah, I lost my virginity. It was underwhelming honestly, and yes I practiced safe sex. Asked for consent every step for the first time, used non-latex non-expired condoms (incase she was allgeric to Latex), and bought plan-b post sex. Oh, and I got a STD test and I'm negative.
It didn't turn in to a serious thing because she's much older than me. While this is a private thing, I feel comfortable sharing here since it's psudeo-anaonymous and she told her co-workers/friends anyway. I haven't told anyone IRL and probably won't. 

Berea now feels like summer camp or a military base. You're free to go but you're spoonfed and babystted like a child. The way faculty and professors treat students is very infantilizing. I'm just ready to get out of here and get back to where I need to be which is working and making actual positive contributions to the world. 
I'm probably going to stop blogging since barely anyone reads my blog.
