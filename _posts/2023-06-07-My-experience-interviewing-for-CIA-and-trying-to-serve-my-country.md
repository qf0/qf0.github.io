I was in middle school, and often playing Battlefield & Call of Duty games. Also watching The Recruit, and The Unit along with veterns day at my public school made me more patriotic. 
After school, I stumbled across the [BUD/s 234 documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCL6TikUoWQ) and watched it. From then on, I knew I wanted to enlist in the military, but I was obese and knew I had to pass a fitness test to enlist.

So, I Googled Navy Seal fitness, and stumbled across [Stew Smith's programs]([Stew Smith's programs](https://www.stewsmithfitness.com/pages/frontpage)). I purchased his The 90 Day Beginner Plan book. Eventually, I lost over 105+lbs by the time I turned 16 years old. At my local gym,
I saw [Navy Warrior Challenger](https://etoolbox.cnrc.navy.mil/warrior.html) candidates taking the [Physical Screening Test](https://navyseals.com/nsw/physical-screening-tests/). I would often observe and sometimes workout with the scouts, because the Navy mentors wouldn't let me until I go to MEPs/get a contract. 

Seeing people vomit from the amount of effort they gave during the workouts to get a contract to be able to enlist in the job they wanted also motiviated me a lot. After I turned 17, I went to a recruiter, but I was rejected due to having Autism Spectrum Disorder. I felt embarrassed, and angry. [Active duty military member's who have ASD can stay in the military](https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2721387/airman-advocates-for-neurodiversity-in-military/), but since I was diagnosed prior to enlisting, I'm disqualified.

So, I thought about other ways I can serve, and working at CIA or NSA came to mind. I started working tech jobs after I turned 18, and I needed to at least be going to college to qualify for an internship or scholarship.
So, I quit my tech job (full-time at IBM) to go to the best college in my state, and I applied for a CIA scholarship since the tuition was very expensive, even though I'm first generation college student and my mother is disabled. 

I received this email from presumably a CIA recruiter after a month (from thread since accidently deleted the OG one).

Unfortunately, I never heard anything back after this.  

I applied next year, and received this email:

![image2](/files/CIA_internship_2.PNG)
![image3](/files/CIA_internship_3.PNG)
![image4](/files/CIA_internship_4.PNG)

I did the test which included some Math, English, and Essay questions, but again I never heard back from CIA.

So, I applied the year after, and this time I received a call from a (703) number while I was working which lasted 45 minutes. I received another call at 0800, but I missed it due to sleeping in. I never heard from them after that.
I thought about other ways about serving such as being a contractor and I interviewed at Raytheon and another company, but I got rejected from both even though I worked full-time and had 2 years of professional experience (I started working again in college).

I got to ask the first ever [CIA CTO](https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/cia-names-first-chief-technology-officer/) (via volunteering), and the former head of the Director of Operations for advise and they said this:
CIA CTO's, Nand Mulchandani's advise/comment: "My experience getting hired at CIA was abnormal, so I wouldn't recommend following my path. Usually, CIA hires directly from college by grooming and they tend to be lifers (i.e. long lasting employees). It's rare for professionals to transfer from .com to .gov."
Proof I got to ask him:

Dr. James Olson's advice:

At this point, I've given up. I still apply, but haven't heard back last year or this year. I see lot's of movies involving characters who work for CIA and news articles about [CIA wanting to hire Gen Z](https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/11/09/how-gen-z-and-the-tiktok-generation-are-becoming-spies/) (My gen) and [The DOD investing money in video game](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ake884/us-army-pay-streamers-millions-call-of-duty)
Perhaps the hype, and grooming allows them to cherry pick and therefor not select me due to some imperfections (my ASD etc.).
