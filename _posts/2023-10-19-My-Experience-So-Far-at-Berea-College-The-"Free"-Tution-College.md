title: "My Experience So Far at Berea College The Free Tution College"

Last August, I resigned from my remote Computer Security job, and started as an undergraduate student at Berea College. You might be wondering why I left the industry to go back to college, and well it's simple. Most employers I want to work at (e.g. .gov) or hedge funds still require at least a Bachelor's unfortunately. Event though I have over two years of full-time experience, have worked at placed like IBM, and Microsoft, and found two 0days, I still get disqualifed due to the lack of pedigree. So, when I heard about Berea College in the Midwest Venture Partners Slack server (owned by tptacek, their Hacker New username)
I thought that I should apply, and I got accepted! Berea attends to only admit low-income students who otherwise couldn't of went to college, and since my mom is disabled, I qualified BTW [0]. I'm majoring in Computer Science, and I transfered from Tulane. Like Aaron Swartz's "Stanford Diaries" I wanted to share my experience at college, albiet not post daily blog posts lik Swartz did [1].

Like Swartz, Sowell, Holt, and others, I don't like education very well and I guess that I have let others know that. When asked what I think of Berea so far, I've replied: "It's like a jail. My room is small, my mattress is like that one a person in jail gets.". I've evened told Dr. Nixion this, who laughed, and probably thought I was joking and I'm not.
We aren't allowed to install Veracrypt, or image a new OS, as well as having a lot of other limitations on our campus provided laptops (which I've been told I can keep post grad). There's Microsoft's EDR installed on our machines, and IT/IS&S probably has the capability to remotely run and execute a PE on our machines.
I can technically disable EDR, Dell's anonnying updater etc, and then spoof any CRC/heartbeat checks, but that'd probably get me kicked out, lol.

Berea's Student Health Insurance is garbage, and the local health services, specifically mental health doesn't accept insurance which screws over essentially every student at Berea [2]. There's free licensed therapist on campus, but they haven't been great in my experience and I think one shared HIPAA protected info internally to other Berea faculty (yes, I've reported the violation). 
Also, the White House clinic nurse psychiatrist is against perscribing Adderal and Xanax. Since my mom is on Medicare and I can't afford to pay the premium for even private Bronze insurance, and since many mental health services places locally don't accept insurance at all, then I'm sort of screwed [4]. I wonder if other Berea students aren't able to get on their parents insurance (which is capped at age 26 btw) and have a similar issue. I've brought this up internally at Berea to the budsman and the person in charge of insurance, but haven't heard anything yet despite multiple follow ups.
I got in trouble too for cursing in an email saying it's bit of a joke now that still nothing has been done which some Berea staff thought was uncivil (lol).

Every student is required to work at least 10 hours per week, and I was lucky enough to work in Engineering/Computer Science as a lab assistant. However, I've heard horror stories of freshman being foisted in to janitor (at dining), or grounds jobs and they can't move out of them. Especially if they fired from their past job.
There's a news article documenting how awful working in dining, and from the few people I know who work in dining, it does suck and Gus (Budsman) tried to censor the articles. Which I've heard, Berea fucked off after getting a legal letter from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education [5][6]. Speaking of The Berea Torch,
I told The Berea Torch founder/writier Ãœlvi Gitaliyev about the Berea medicial issue, but was told: "We aren't your slave" and I replied "So, I'm supposed to do your job for you and write the entire article myself?", he: "well we aren't paid", me: "There's lots of journalists not paid that still investigate and write thing", him: "well we don't have time. As you know Berea is pretty busy", me: "...", him: "send us more information.". 
So I figured I'd go ahead and write about it myself. 

The "Free Tution Promise" is bit misleading or a scam, because there's many students who still pay out of pocket, and one student who is international still has to pay $20,000 per year I recall. It's less than other colleges, sure, but not 100% free.
Also, the federal government gives Berea funding each year to pay it's student workers ($6/hr) which is below min wage, but Berea says other aid results in it being $34/hr, but the rest goes towards your tution and you don't get the actual cash like the $6/hr.
