title: "How to Sideload on an Onn"

I recently purchased an Onn streaming device, before the Prime day Fire Stick 4k sale. After a few Google searches, and looking on Reddit, I wasn't able to find an answer if sideloading on an Onn is possible. 
However, after successfully sideloading myself I found the answer and thought I'd make a blog post showing how I did it for uhh educational purposes. 

1. Download Downloader app. Search in the search box under Search Apps, and select install.
2. Open Downloader.
3. Enter the number shortner or navigate to download URL of the APK you'd like to install.
4. Download the app/APK.
5. It will open the download page so click on the app/APK.
6. Select install.
7. Eventually it will prompt you to the setting to allow the APK to be installed from an unknown source. Select yes if you indeed want to install the app/APK.
8. I had to switch back using the arrow button next to the home button and select install again.
9. Profit?? The app/APK should be installed now!!!

I want to note that if you want to uninstall the app, then you have to go to settings, apps, and then select uninstall. Pressing the white "ok" button only gives unknown apps the ability to open or move it's position unfortunately. 
Also, please scan unknown apps on VirusTotal. I wish there was an online hybrid-analysis like site for analysing APK files but there isn't as far I could tell. So, be wary of unknown apps. 

To download an app/APK from Downloader's number shortner on PC browse to https://afv.news/<short number here> in a web browser. Looking at the mainifest is a good start for analysis. 

Also, yes, the Downloader app is on the Google Play Store once again, [https://www.aftvnews.com/my-downloader-app-is-back-in-the-google-play-store-for-android-tv-google-tv-devices/](https://www.aftvnews.com/my-downloader-app-is-back-in-the-google-play-store-for-android-tv-google-tv-devices/).
