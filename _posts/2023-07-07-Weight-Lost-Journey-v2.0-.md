You may be wondering, why v2.0? Well, when I was 13-16, I was obese too. I lost 105+ lbs by exercising. Unfortunately, after some adversity
and personal issues, I've gained the weight back and then some.

I currently weigh 272 lbs and I'm 5'8. Havard's BMI calculator signals that I'm indeed obese. I'm in my young 20s by the way. Back pain,
and other things have justified to myself this unacceptable weight gain activities. However, excuses are BS, and this is unacceptable.

I can't even walk without being winded. I'm changing my diet which has been enabling this unhealthy weight gain, and I'll be exercising more.
My goal is to return to a normal weight limit and disengage from self destructive bad self control judgement. 

I created a Twitch channel (OG username. Twitch app on my phone claimed 3 char usernames are ok, but Twitch.tv on my laptop says 4 chars) and even
streamed for a bit, but I used a bit of data, phone got hot and I feel uncomfortable sharing personal identifiable information, so I stopped.

Anyway, I hope my journey will be fruitful.
