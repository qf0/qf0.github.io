I currently have a mid 750s credit score with a few years of credit. When I was first starting out, I had no job and was in college. I did some open-source intelligence to gather information on what I should do, and mistakes I should avoid. Generally, I like to learn from the mistakes of others rather than learn the hard way.
One Reddit user stated that getting a secured card would be easier for college students, and I applied for some, but I got rejected due to not having any credit and not working. Finally, Discover took a chance on me and gave me a small limit credit card. After I got that I called their support to get a support password added to my account, and to request a certian type of card style with good points.

One thread gave the advice of getting the statement date, and due date. Then paying all of the balance expect less than 10%, so the statement will show 10% or less than utilization percentile and thus give a higher FICO score. That method has worked very well for me. Also not missing a due date, and paying on time or setting up payments. Though that requires you to have the money to be able to pay that amount off etc. The interest rate seems higher than credit union rates, so if I wanted to borrow money, then I'd recommend going to a credit union.
