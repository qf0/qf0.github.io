In a [Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23pbqx/im_steve_case_cofounder_of_aol_and_now_chairman/), former AOL's CEO Steve Case [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialcitizens/comments/23oddi/im_steve_case_cofounder_of_aol_and_now_chairman/cgz7yka/) that Mark Zuckerberg was an AOL hacker. By stating the following to someone who was apologizing for their role in the AOL hacking scene:

```
Yikes! Well, Iâ€™m glad you got this off your chest! ðŸ™‚ The hacking of AOL was a real challenge for us. As AOL grew in prominence, it became a big target. 
Of course, some of the hackers have gone on to do more productive things. It sounds like that is the case with you, and 
it also was the case with Mark Zuckerberg! Went I first met him 6 or 7 years ago he said he learned how to 
program by hacking AIM! But, thankfully, rather than focusing on bring AOL down, he shifted to build Facebook up! 
```

There's also comments on the Reddit thread by ytcracker etc. I presumed this story would've gotten published by major digital media sites by now. However, only one [blog](http://patorjk.com/blog/2014/04/27/steve-case-confirms-zuckerberg-as-former-aol-hacker/) posted about this in 2014 that I could find. Myspace Tom was also a [hacker](https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/30/myspace-cofounder-tom-anderson-was-a-real-life-wargames-hacker-in-1980s/) back in the day.
