I've made some FOIA requests regarding a few OG computer related infamous groups/people and here's what I've gathered so far.

Inner Circle, OG computer hacking group: [FBI Inner Circle Vault PDF](https://vault.fbi.gov/inner-circle/inner-circle-part-01-of-01/view)

John Mcafee: [FBI Vault Part 1](https://vault.fbi.gov/john-mcafee/john-mcafee-part-01/view) awaiting part 2

Jerome T. Heckenkamp, affilated with Unix Terroist and other OGs: In-Progress

Operation Buccaneer, first US operation against Warez groups AFAIU: In-Progress
