I decided to write a post about how to prevent identity theft or well do the most you can do. Register an account on irs.gov, ssa.gov, signup for incoming mail notifications from usps, fedex, dhl, and ups. 
Enable MFA (TOTP or physical token based) on all accounts and use randomly generated passwords from KeePass or another secure password manager. Freeze your credit at big 4 credit bureaus and other places that allow you to do it like KYC places etc. [1].
Shred documents with PII/PI with a microcut shredder. Don't give PII/PI to unsolicted vistors/callers. Never give out your SSN to anyone that doesn't need it or to shady sites.
