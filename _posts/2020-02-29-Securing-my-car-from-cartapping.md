Some of you may know, that modern cars can be as much of a security threat as a smartphone. If not, you can check out this [forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/01/15/police-spying-on-car-conversations-location-siriusxm-gm-chevrolet-toyota-privacy/#278285dc2ef8) , or this [techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170116/09333936490/law-enforcement-has-been-using-onstar-siriusxm-to-eavesdrop-track-car-locations-more-than-15-years.shtml) article to learn how modern cars share your location, and can be used as a listening device.
OnStar, SirusXM etc. Have been used by the feds/LE against criminals. Of course I'm not a criminal, but I'd definitely like to disable this feature. To keep my conversations, and location within my car private. In one case in the above articles, a driver didn't even pay for OnStar/SirusXM. However the feds were still able to listen remotely by the in car microphone.

## Disabling these features

Few ways come to mind to accomplish this. Physically removing, or disconnecting the microphone, and OnStar etc from my car comes first.
So, of course I'm not a mechanic. So I started to think of other ways to do it. I was reading my car's manual, and stumbled on the fuses page. I found OnStar/SirusXM, located my fuse box, and simply removed the fuse. I tested a OnStar/SirusXM feature, and it didn't work. Success!
However, there are a few down sides of disabling OnStar/SirusXM. Such as the USB ports in my car no longer work, so I can't charge my phone or listen to local media. Convenience, or privacy I suppose.

## Notes/End
I've actually disabled this in my car multiple years ago, just got around to writing this. Of course I would like to physically remove the microphone etc. from my car. However, like I said, I'm not a mechanic. I don't want to [brick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)#Types) my car either lol. 
The simplicity of plugging the fuse back in to re-enable such features is nice as well.
