# Bars

## Drinks
The drinks are overpriced and the bar staff like forces you to purchase a drink. Also the fact that you're trusting the bar tender or anyone else not to drug your drink. The job requirements to become a bar tender is low afaik and there's usually no background check etc. Plus the work itself is usually sketchy.

## Social aspect    
It's hard to even have a conversation because the music is usually so loud. People usually go to bars to have casual sex or to drink with other people, but usually unruly people gos to bars so it isn't attractive to me. 

## Drinking at home
When you drink at home you don't have to worry about how you're going to get home or someone taking advantage of you. 

# Gyms

## Membership Fees

The membership fee is usually some ridiculous amount like $100 and some gyms try to cajole you in to singing a contract. 

## Sharing

Most gyms have such a high amount of traffic that you can't really workout without someone stealing the machine you're using etc. 

## At home workouts

Working out at home is the cheapest and best option in my opinion. You can do calisthenics at home which is the natural way to work out. Plus you don't get pressured to purchase stuff and get odd stares etc. The U.S. Navy has a mobile app that has workouts and nutrition advice etc. https://www.applocker.navy.mil/#!/apps/EA7A70B4-50E4-44D2-8362-5BCC2296D49F.
