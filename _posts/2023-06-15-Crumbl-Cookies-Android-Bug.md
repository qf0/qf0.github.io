title: "Crumbl Cookies Android Bug"

I stumbled on a bug in Crumbl Cookie's Android app where if you select a custom tip amount, and select $0, then try to pay, it'll give a payment related error. I verified this with two different payment methods, and when I changed the tip to $1 it worked. 
I've tried contacting them, but their Android email, but it bounced.
