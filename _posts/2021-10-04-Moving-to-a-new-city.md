title: "Moving to a new city"

So, I recently moved across the country to a new city. I'm going to be vague about where I moved to due to fears of harassment, doxing etc. Also because I'm a private person. I feel comfortable sharing vague details about my moving journey to my publicly viewable indexed blog.
I was working remotely for my current employer.  Then I decided to relocate to a big city. I can work remotely from anywhere I want. But I picked a big city due to being sick of living in rural areas. Though I briefly lived in a medium city. Though it still felt like where I lived before. While just being more expensive.
I virtual toured a few different apartments, and studios. 

Finally deciding on this one place with cheap rent, and it's near public transit.  So after I found where I wanted to live, I started to do research on what would be the cheapest way to get my stuff, and myself there. I looked at the U-Hual box thing, moving companies, and different rent a truck companies. Finally deciding on a reputable truck rental company. Some of my family dumpster dived for cardboard boxes. Then It took about 1 and a half hours to load everything in to the truck. Then it took me a day of driving, night stay, and two more hours of driving to get to my new home.
I speedran my moving journey, haha. I only stopped to use the bathroom twice. I wouldn't recommend it to others. I do recommend getting insurance on the moving truck though. I had a few scares along the way. Especially driving in big cities. I was very scard while driving in cities. Since I didn't have much prior experience driving in big cities before.
But after all I made it in one piece, and on time :).
